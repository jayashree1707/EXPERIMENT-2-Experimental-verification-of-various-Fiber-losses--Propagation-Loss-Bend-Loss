# EXPERIMENT-2 OPTICAL COMMUNICATION
## 🔍 EX.NO: 2 – Verification of Fiber Losses

# AIM:  
To measure propagation and bending losses for two wavelengths in plastic fiber.

# EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED: 
- Link-B Kit  
- Patch chords  
- Oscilloscope  
- Function Generator  
- Fiber cables  

# THEORY:
- Losses due to absorption, scattering, bending  
- Plastic fiber loss ~180 dB/km  
- Bending loss increases with reduced loop diameter  

# PROCEDURE:  
- Setup for 660nm and 950nm measurements  
- Measure output voltages for 1m and 3m fibers  
- Calculate attenuation \( a \) using:  
V1/V2 = e [ -a (L1+L2 ) ] 
- Bend fiber and record output vs diameter  

# TABULATION:

### Propagation Loss

| Fiber Length | Input Amplitude (V) | Output Amplitude (V) |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|
|     0.5m     |        2V           |        10V           |
|     1 m      |        2V           |        6.8V          |

### Bending Loss

| Bending Diameter | Input Amplitude (V) | Output Amplitude (V) |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
|      0.5m        |         2V          |        6.8V          |
|      1 m         |         2V          |        5.2V          |

# RESULT:
Attenuation and bending loss characteristics verified.
